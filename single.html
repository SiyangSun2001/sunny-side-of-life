								<p>Judging from the picture and the timing of the post, one will likely mistake this as a pro-Trump message congratulating him on his victory. However, as a non-citizen, I cannot vote, so I cannot formally support any candidate. Instead, I am here to give my two cents on a Trump rally I attended and the 2024 election on the Republican side.</p>

								<p>I have always treated my time in the States as a bird of passage since I am alone on a non-immigrant visa. So, I never had a real stake in social issues, and I ignored much of the political scene here besides taking AP gov in high school. But to understand America comprehensively, I need to experience American democracy, one of the most important pillars of America, firsthand. Therefore, I took a four-hour drive to attend a Trump rally in Pennsylvania and observe American democracy in action.</p>

								<p>Once I arrived at the parking lot, it was packed with supporters, flags, motorcycles, and huge pickup trucks. The ambiance took on a festive feeling. I thought I had arrived at a county fair instead of my impression of a political rally. Some ethnic minority groups supported Trump. Consisting mainly of Korean and Japanese Americans, they were waving Korean and Japanese flags alongside MAGA flags. I wonder what flags would pro-Trump Chinese Americans fly. It would be quite ironic to see the PRC flag flown alongside the MAGA flag. After all, the PRC was painted as the number one adversary during Trump’s previous term.</p>

								<p>While waiting in line for security, I had a great conversation with two friendly Trump supporters about politics, social issues, and international diplomacy. It gave me more confidence in American democracy, as we were able to have a respectful, civilized discussion—contrary to the beliefs of some Democrat supporters.</p>

								<p>They did have a hostile view towards the Sino-American relationship, stating that America should not rely on Chinese manufacturing and decouple. This did make me proud as a Chinese person - being viewed as a worthy competitor in the world arena. The harsh diplomatic tactic employed by the Chinese government in recent years facilitated this decoupling effort by convincing the American people that China is indeed an adversary. If a softer diplomatic strategy were used on the Chinese side, the Chinese economy could be in a better situation with fewer tariffs and more exports.</p>

								<p>As soon as I walked into the arena, I started to lose confidence in American democracy. A few minutes later, Trump walked on stage, dancing to 'YMCA' with his signature moves. I cannot help but find this scene comical and similar to an Instagram meme. I instantly felt a deep connection with Trump.</p>

								<p>At that moment, I understood why people could support him despite his questionable policies. It's the meme factor and his apparent humanness on stage, unlike other political figures that build a strong, friendly connection with the masses. I do not believe people should vote solely based on emotions but should instead vote rationally based on proposed policies. I finally understood why the American democratic process is sometimes described as supporting a sports team or celebrity: it is the emotions that matter.</p>

								<p>Scattered throughout his speech, people chanted “TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” with their fists in the air. Along with the MAGA hats, I do not see much difference between the Cultural Revolution Parade in China and this rally. This cult-like behavior reminds me of The Wave, a German novel on the forces of group pressure. Before I came to this rally, I still had hope of a perfect American democracy as described in my history lessons with bright thinkers presenting well-thought-out proposals and different parties ending in compromises. But at the rally, I saw an incited mass chanting the name of the candidate and supporting whatever policy was presented without much critical thinking involved.</p>

								<p>The most shocking scene for me was seeing a kid holding up a Trump sign at the rally. A primary school child cannot critically think about important social issues to support a candidate. This early exposure to one side of the rhetoric is no different than the communist youth brigade inside the Iron Curtain.</p>

								<p>Attending this rally made me understand and reflect on the status quo of American democracy. It does contain rational people freely expressing their beliefs, but this system is far from perfect. Maybe it is the best democratic system we have known thus far, but I do not believe it should be proliferated to other countries with different cultural, political, and historical backgrounds. Since this system is flawed, it works given the history and culture of this land, but it is irresponsible to force other countries upon this flawed system.</p>

								<p>On a more positive note, I did see the First Amendment in Action with freedom of speech and assembly - in my opinion, an important tool to keep the government in check. I also saw ordinary people participating in politics involving more than one party, which is still very much a luxury in many parts of the world. The friendly and candid exchange of ideas I had with people at the rally gave me hope that, with more cross-cultural and partisan  exchange, people will see the imperfection and American democracy will evolve to a better form. I do wish that I had the time to attend a Democrat rally so that I could perform a more comprehensive analysis of American Democracy. Maybe this is an activity for the 2028 election year……To be continued in 4 years!</p>
